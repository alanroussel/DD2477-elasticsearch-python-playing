* Steps to get the server working:

1. Go to 'server.py' and replace the password that is there with your own elastic search password that was generated when you set up elastic search.

2. Go to the 'elasticsearch'-container in Docker Desktop. 

3. Go to files and then /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs and copy the file 'http_ca.crt'.

4. Put the file in the 'Website'-directory (same directory as 'server.py'). 

5. Replace the the path of the 'ca_certs'-parameter in line 5 with the path to the 'http_ca.crt'-file. 

6. Replace the path to the 'template_folder'-parameter in line 6 with the path to the template folder in the 'Website'-directory. 

7. Replace 'my_index' in line 10 with the name of the index in elasticsearch. NOTE: All this assume that you have indexed davisWiki already. 

8. Run 'server.py'. 

9. Go to http://localhost:5000

10. Done.
