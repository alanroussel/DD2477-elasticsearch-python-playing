- Steps to get the server working:

1. Create a folder and put inside a config.json file { "password": "yourelasticpassword" } and the http_ca.crt. To find that certificate, go to the 'elasticsearch'-container in Docker Desktop, go to files and then /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs and copy the file 'http_ca.crt'. That folder should not be pushed in github.

2. If not done yet, run index.py file in order to index the database.

3. Run 'server.py'.

4. Go to http://localhost:5000
