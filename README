ðŸš€ Steps to Get the Server Working

1. To launch a local instance of Elasticsearch, follow the "Get Started/Run Elasticsearch locally/Start Elasticsearch" steps in the official [Elasticsearch GitHub repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). For this project, we used version 8.7.0.

2. During launching, copy your Elasticsearch password as it will be needed for the following step. Once the container is up, go to the 'elasticsearch'-container in Docker Desktop, go to files and then `/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs` and copy the file `http_ca.crt`.

3. In the current project, place `http_ca.crt` inside the `credentials` folder. Inside `config.json`, paste your Elasticsearch password. The certificate and password both ensure a secure connection between this Python application and your Elasticsearch instance.

4. Unzip `davisWiki.tar`.

5. You need to install a few packages for this project. If you are using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file), you can use the following command to create the environment `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Then, activate it with `conda activate elasticsearch_env`.

6. Run `python index.py` to index the database into Elasticsearch. The indexing should take between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.

7. Run `python server.py`.

8. Go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) ðŸŽ‰!
